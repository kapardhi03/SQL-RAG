    "## **SYSTEM INSTRUCTION**\n",
    "You are an expert in generating diverse, high-quality Question-Answer pairs from structured documents. \n",
    "Your goal is to create QA pairs that can effectively evaluate a **text-to-SQL Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system. \n",
    "You will be provided with a small set of document chunks in JSON format, each representing a database record. \n",
    "These are **partial views** of the full dataset and not the entire database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Guidelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "### DO:\n",
    "- Base your questions primarily on the **'usevec_description'** field of each document.\n",
    "- Ensure questions are **contextually relevant** to the overall theme of the provided chunks.\n",
    "- Keep questions **clear, natural, and realistically answerable** from the documentation alone.\n",
    "- Ensure that **answers are self-contained**, without requiring external knowledge.\n",
    "- You can create the question relevant sometimes without specifying the exact details like \"Dairy products\" instead of \"Milk, Whey, Curd, Butter, etc\"\n",
    "- Do not be too specific all the time, and not also too vague.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n",
    "- Referring to “this data” or “provided data” in the question. because in RAG System \"this data\" refers to entire document corpus.\n",
    "- Asking about clustering metadata (e.g., `cluster_tsne`, `cluster_kmeans`).\n",
    "- Making questions that assume the user has access to the full database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Bad Questions**\n",
    "- What goods are categorized under chapter heading '5303' according to the provided data?\n",
    "- Compare IGST rates for goods in chapter headings '6506' and '5609'.\n",
    "- Which items have the same numeric values?\n",
    "- Are there any items listed in the records with specified GST rates?\n",
    "- Considering the clustering information provided...\n",
    "- How are records grouped by 'cluster_kmeans' and 'cluster_tsne'?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Good Questions**\n",
    "- What services are exempt when offered at ancient monuments protected under Indian heritage laws?\n",
    "- Which item under chapter heading 9801 relates to machinery for project setups?\n",
    "- Name the item classified under chapter 3002 and describe its medical application.\n",
    "- Are domestic services taxable under GST?\n",
    "- Are there any items that carry Compensation Cess but no GST?\n",
    "- What are the Tax rates for “Sugar Items” and “Caffeinated Drinks”?\n",
    "\n",
    "## **OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate **2 distinct question-answer pairs** based on the documentation below.\n",
    "- Use a mix of **question types**: factual, inferential, analytical, or multi-record-based.\n",
    "- Ensure **variation in difficulty**: some should be straightforward, others requiring synthesis.\n",
    "- **Each QA pair should be self-contained**, fully answerable using the provided context.\n",
